# Excel-Image-Generator
Excel image generator - Java

Ever wondered how you can convert JPG or PNG Images to Excel files?
This tool loads an image, looks at it pixel by pixel and saves the RGB values in an array. With that array an excel file is generated where each cell is dyed in the corresponding color. - Basically it saves your JPG or PNG images to an XLSX Format.
